# First list pull requests.

gh api repos/AMReX-Codes/amrex/pulls

From this you can pull the PR number under "number"

Then you can check the "forks_url:"

"forks_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/etpalmer63/amrex/forks:"

strip the user name and repository

gh api repos/AMReX-Codes/amrex/pulls/2354 | jq .head.repo.url


head branch is what's being merged into base.


To get most recent pull

gh api repos/AMReX-Codes/amrex/pulls/2354

gh api repos/AMReX-Codes/amrex/pulls/2354 | jq.head.label


Still need to get issue number from a comment

Check the most recent comment.

gh api repos/AMReX-Codes/amrex/issues/comments | jq .[0].issue_url

Then strip the number?

Seems like the way forward is just to curl for all api information.
